## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

First of all I would like to say a big thank you to [As a Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/@asaprogrammer_) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), because this project was made with the help of video tutorials from him

Even though this project was made with the help of video tutorials and ideas from other people, I made this project from scratch with my own coding style, and there are also several things that are different from this project from those made by [As a Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/@asaprogrammer_), so don't forget to check the project.
